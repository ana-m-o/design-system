# Banner

Banners will be shown to inform users of updates or **changes in system status**.

Users should always receive appropriate messages **to help them complete their tasks**. Make sure your notifications are necessary and informative.

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Banner} />

## Usage

The status of the notifications **informs about the criticality** of the information we are communicating to the users. To highlight these differences we will use a specific color and icon for each different status or level of criticality.

### Info
The Info Banner provides additional information to users that may not even be related to their current action or task, **do not require immediate action** and can be closed with a delay or by user action, depending on the context.

<Banner
  description="This is the Banner message, it turns into title if there is description"
  message="Notification title"
  showIcon
  type="info"
  closable
/>

### Success
The Success Banner confirms when a task or process has been successfully completed. In general, it also **do not require immediate action and can be closed** with a delay or via user action, depending on the context.

<Banner
  description="This is the Banner message, it turns into title if there is description"
  message="Notification title"
  showIcon
  type="success"
  closable
/>


### Warning
The Banner informs users they are performing actions that may produce unexpected or undesired results.  They are usually **visible until the user dismisses** the notification or continues the task.

<Banner
  description="This is the Banner message, it turns into title if there is description"
  message="Notification title"
  showIcon
  type="warning"
  closable
/>

### Error
The Banner informs users of a **critical error** or failure and, optionally, it displays a dialog box that **blocks interaction until the problem has been resolved or a decision has been consciously made by the user**. It always persist until the user dismisses them or resolves the error.

<Banner
  description="This is the Banner message, it turns into title if there is description"
  message="Notification title"
  showIcon
  type="error"
  closable
/>
