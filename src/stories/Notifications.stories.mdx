# Notifications

Notifications allow you to **communicate with users** and provide them with **information at important or necessary moments**. Notifications can be presented visually in different ways and classified according to the importance or criticality of the message.

**Critically Level**

-   Informational
-   Success
-   Warning
-   Error

**Visual Representation**

-   Inline
-   Modal
-   Banner
-   Notification panel
-   Toast

## Anatomy

They can be classified based on two dimensions: The **criticality level** and its **visual representation**.

### Critically Levels

### Visual Representation

<img src={notifications01} width={"100%"} />

## Functionality

Based on functional criteria, it is important to classify notifications according to the criticality of the event we need to notify users.

<img src={notifications02} width={"100%"} />

### Info

Provide **additional information** to users that may not be related to their current action or task; system information, updates, etc.

They **do not require immediate action** and can be closed with a timer or persist until user request.

### Success

They will be used to inform about a **process finished successfully**.

They usually **do not require any additional action** and can be automatically discarded or persist in a non-intrusive format.

### Warning

Inform users that they are performing **actions that could have unexpected results**.

They usually persist until the **user dismisses the notification**.

### Error

Inform users of a **critical error or failure** and, when necessary, block the user from continuing the process.

They always **persist until the user dismisses the warning or resolves the error**.

## Usage

We will use different notifications format (components) depending on the use requirements.

| TYPE                   | USAGE                                                                                                    | DURATION                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inline**             | Provide users with information on the status of a current action                                         | Persists until resolved or discarded by the user and can include a hide/close button                                 |
| **Toast**              | Short messages that slide in and out of a page and provide information that does not require user action | It disappears automatically or can be discarded by the user                                                          |
| **Banner**             | System or product notifications specifics to a task                                                      | It persists until discarded by the user and may include a close button, link to extended information or retry button |
| **Notification Panel** | Notification center providing users with system-generated messages                                       | It opens and closes by user action. Usually allows to delete or archive notifications                                |
| **Modal**              | Intrusive notifications that provide users with critical information that requires attention or action   | They persist and block tasks until the user discards them                                                            |

## General recommendations

Notifications should be:

-   **Relevants** The notifications will be related to the process being performed by the user and will be presented in the context of that process.
-   **Timely** It is important that the user receives information at the right time and critical notifications are seen immediately.
-   **Meaningful** In addition to the reported event, the notification will provide the user with context and facilitate possible actions when necessary.
