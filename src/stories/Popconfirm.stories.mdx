# PopConfirm

PopConfirm is used to show a medium disruptive notification that provide users with critical information that needs their attention or action. 

Like the modal dialog box, the PopConfirm persists and blocks tasks until the user makes a choice. However, Popconfirm displays the options panel beside the triggering element, it is more comfortable for the user.



## Props

Information about the properties and implementation of the component can be found at https://ant.design/components/popconfirm/  


Example of a PopConfirm application:

<Popconfirm
    title="Are you sure to destroy the universe?"
    onConfirm={() => message.success('Click on Yes')}
    onCancel={() => message.error('Click on No')}
    okText="Yes, destroy"
    cancelText="No, not today"
  >
    <Button
    type="primary"
    >
    Click here to destroy universe
    </Button>
</Popconfirm>


## Usage

Recommendations on how to use the PopConfirm component in a user-friendly and understandable way.

+ It is recommended to indicate explicitly the action in the text/literal of the button. For example, if the application is going to perform a delete action when we press the button, instead of simply putting "yes" we should put "yes, delete".
+ When the user confirms, the component should execute the action.
