# Alert

Alerts will be shown to inform users of updates or **changes in system status**.

Users should always receive appropriate messages **to help them complete their tasks**. Make sure your notifications are necessary and informative.

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Alert} />

## Usage

The status of the notifications **informs about the criticality** of the information we are communicating to the users. To highlight these differences we will use a specific color and icon for each different status or level of criticality.

### Info

The Info Alert provides additional information to users that may not even be related to their current action or task, **do not require immediate action** and can be closed with a delay or by user action, depending on the context.

<Alert
    description="This is the Alert message, it turns into title if there is description"
    message="Notification title"
    showIcon
    type="info"
    closable
/>

### Success

The Success Alert confirms when a task or process has been successfully completed. In general, it also **do not require immediate action and can be closed** with a delay or via user action, depending on the context.

<Alert
    description="This is the Alert message, it turns into title if there is description"
    message="Notification title"
    showIcon
    type="success"
    closable
/>

### Warning

The Alert informs users they are performing actions that may produce unexpected or undesired results. They are usually **visible until the user dismisses** the notification or continues the task.

<Alert
    description="This is the Alert message, it turns into title if there is description"
    message="Notification title"
    showIcon
    type="warning"
    closable
/>

### Error

The Alert informs users of a **critical error** or failure and, optionally, it displays a dialog box that **blocks interaction until the problem has been resolved or a decision has been consciously made by the user**. It always persist until the user dismisses them or resolves the error.

<Alert
    description="This is the Alert message, it turns into title if there is description"
    message="Notification title"
    showIcon
    type="error"
    closable
/>
